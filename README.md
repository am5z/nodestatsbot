# nodestatsbot v2

This is a Discord bot using Discord.js v14 for hosts so that their customers / users can see the statistics of the nodes. If you use this, star this repo (for absolutely no reason other than it looks nice).

## Original v1 Bot

Nodestatsbot v1 was released in 2020 and can be found at https://github.com/srydencloud/nodestatsbot

## Installation

I recommend using the Node.js egg and creating servers on your panel. There should be on on each node with Nodestatsbot uploaded to each.
